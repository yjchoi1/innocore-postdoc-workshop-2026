## Overview

This repository contains hands-on tutorial notebooks for the **LLM lecture session** of the 2026 PRISM-AI InnoCORE Workshop. The workshop brings together postdoctoral researchers across the PRISM-AI consortium to share research progress, explore collaboration opportunities, and build practical AI skills.

**Workshop goals:**
- Share PRISM-AI research directions and InnoCORE program updates
- Provide career development insights from senior researchers
- Enable postdocs to integrate LLM technologies into their own research domains
- Strengthen interdisciplinary collaboration through poster sessions and networking

## Tutorial Notebooks

All notebooks run on **Google Colab** — no local setup required. Replace `"YOUR API KEY"` with your OpenAI API key in the first cell.

| Notebook | Topics Covered |
|----------|---------------|
| [Tutorial 1 — LangChain Basics](PRISM-AI%20Tutorial_1.ipynb) | LLM chains, prompt engineering, memory, chatbot |
| [Tutorial 2 — RAG](PRISM-AI%20Tutorial_2.ipynb) | Document loading, text splitting, FAISS vector store, RAG chain, conversational RAG |
| [Tutorial 3 — Multi-agent Systems](PRISM-AI%20Tutorial_3.ipynb) | LangGraph (StateGraph, conditional edges, ReAct agent, Supervisor pattern), AutoGen (RoundRobin, SelectorGroupChat, tool-using agents) |

### Quick Start (Colab)

1. Open any notebook via the links above (or Google Colab → File → Open notebook → GitHub tab)
2. Set your API key:
   ```python
   import os
   os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = "sk-..."
   ```
3. Run all cells top to bottom

### Dependencies

```
langchain langchain-openai langchain-community
faiss-cpu pypdf tiktoken beautifulsoup4
langgraph
autogen-agentchat autogen-ext[openai] nest_asyncio
```

## Featured Research: IM-Chat

One highlight from the poster session — developed by the tutorial lecturer:

**"LLM-based Knowledge Transfer System for Injection Molding: Implementation and Performance Enhancement"**  
*Junhyeong Lee, Joon-Young Kim, Heekyu Kim, Inhyo Lee, Seunghwa Ryu*  
KAIST InnoCORE PRISM-AI Center

**IM-Chat** is a Supervisor-Worker multi-agent LLM framework for injection molding process decision support. It integrates RAG, tool-calling, and a diffusion-model-based process condition generator (CFGDM), enabling natural language-driven decision support for non-expert operators.
